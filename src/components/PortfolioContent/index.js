            For this project, my team and I were tasked with creating the structure 
            for an eCommerce app. This app was to be used for our comapny, Revature,
            to sell different pieces of merchandise when needed. We then handed the 
            project off to the next team who were tasked with giving the project 
            a cohesive design and products to sell.
